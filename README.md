<h1>**HARDWARE TERMS**</h1><br>


Hardware is the term referring to all the physical parts in a computer system. It includes the monitor, the keyboard, the mouse, the main case which stores the RAM, CPU and the motherboard.

<h2><b>1.Motherboard</h2></b><br>
The motherboard (sometimes called the mainboard or logic board) is the main circuit board in a computer or device. All internal components connect to the motherboard in some fashion including the RAM, hard drive(s), power supply, USB ports, etc.
The motherboard is generally housed within a casing providing access ports for supported external devices like the keyboard, mouse and monitor.

CPU means ‘Central Processing Unit’. This is the place of computer data handling. Moreover, it does all the data manipulation, calculations and formatting data for output. 

<h2><b>3.GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit)</b></h2><br>
A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.

  <b>*Layer 7 : Application Layer</b> - The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. <br>

  <b>*Layer 6 : Presentation Layer</b> - The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compresses                   data so it is received correctly on the other end.<br>

 <b>*Layer 5 : Session Layer</b> - The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices.<br>

  <b>*Layer 4 : Transport Layer </b>- The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end.<br>

 <b>*Layer 3 : Networking Layer </b>- The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the                       receiving end.<br>

 <b>*Layer 2 : Data-Link-Layer </b>- The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.<br>

<h1><b>**BLOCKCHAIN**</b></h1><br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b2eb1dd-07f3-4e8d-9d3e-ac8bfa3cef7d"><br>
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data.Those transactions show the movement of an asset that can be tangible or intangible. Each block is connected to the ones before and after it. These blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes hands. The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.
